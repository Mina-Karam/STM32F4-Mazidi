 * This is a non-blocking function to read the keypad.
 * If a key is pressed, it returns a unique code for the key.
 * Otherwise, a zero is returned.
 * PC6-9 are used as input and connected to the columns. Pull-up resistors are
 * enabled so when the keys are not pressed, these pins are pulled high.
 * PC4-7 are used as output that drives the keypad rows.
 * First, all rows are driven low and the input pins are read. If no key is
 * pressed, they will read as all one because of the pull up resistors.
 * If they are not all one, some key is pressed.
 * If some key is pressed, the program proceeds to drive only one row low at
 * a time and leave the rest of the rows inactive (float) then read the input pins.
 * Knowing which row is active and which column is active, the program can decide
 * which key is pressed.
 *
 * Only one row is driven so that if multiple keys are pressed and row pins are
 * shorted, the microcontroller will not be damaged. When the row is being
 * deactivated, it is driven high first otherwise the stray capacitance may keep
 * the inactive row low for some time.
